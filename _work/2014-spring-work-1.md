I have had the opportunity to work at a few companies to showcase my cybersecurity skills. I am currently open to internship opportunities where I can highligth my skills in machine learning and security.

### Technology Support Intern at BlueCross BlueShield Alabama

*May 2024 - June 2024* 

With Python, I created a program to web scrape multiple websites and gather benign & malicious files. The program would then upload each website to [Binvis.io](https://binvis.io/#/) which would then convert the file into a visual representation by binary class.

The program would then train a neural network using TensorFlow and classify images by either benign or malicious tags. Testing included inputing user's files to run through program and test against the model to ensure user's digital safety. Program released a 93% accuracy rate.
