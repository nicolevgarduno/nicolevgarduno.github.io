Binary Visualization for Detecting Benign & Malicious Files
======
*Using a machine learning model to train a neural network to be able to distinguish between malicious & benign PDFs through a binary visualization representation.* 


Using Python, I created a program to web scrape multiple websites and gather benign & malicious files. The program would then upload each website to [Binvis.io](https://binvis.io/#/) which would then convert the file into a visual representation by binary class.

The program would then train a neural network using TensorFlow and classify images by either benign or malicious tags. Testing included inputing user's files to run through program and test against the model to ensure user's digital safety. Program released a 93% accuracy rate.
