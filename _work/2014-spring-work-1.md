I have had the opportunity to work at a few companies to showcase my cybersecurity skills. I am currently open to internship opportunities where I can highligth my skills in machine learning and security.

### Technology Support Intern at BlueCross BlueShield Alabama

*May 2024 - June 2024* 

With Python, I created a program to web scrape multiple websites and gather benign & malicious files. The program would then upload each website to [Binvis.io](https://binvis.io/#/) which would then convert the file into a visual representation by binary class.

The program would then train a neural network using TensorFlow and classify images by either benign or malicious tags. Testing included inputing user's files to run through program and test against the model to ensure user's digital safety. Program released a 93% accuracy rate.

### Cybersecurity Analyst at Southern Reseach Insititue.

*January 2024 - May 2024* 

After completing my internship at Southern Research Institute, I was invited to return as a part-time employee within the IT team. I was incredibly grateful for the opportunity as it was that internship that helped me realize that security was the path I wanted to pursue!!!

My duties consisted of patchworking softwares and reaching out to company accounts who had possibly been phished. I also continued similar duties as my internship which included inventory control and device maintenance. 

### Cybersecurity Analyst Intern at Southern Reseach Insititue.

*September 2023 - November 2023* 

During my internship I worked with asset security, a critical function of securing the enterprise environment, which included keeping log of stored computers along with outputting new hire computer/ desktop set ups. I worked on imaging and configuring computers for staff, specifically on Windows computers, ensuring that new hires were easy to onboard. Along with new hires, I was tasked with making sure proper disposal of hardware for offboarding employees.
