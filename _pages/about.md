👩🏻‍💻 I am a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University.

🔬 My research interests include intertwining digital security with artifical intelligence.

💻 I am currently working on protecting user's safety by visualizing PDF documents.

🎞️ In my free time, I love taking and developing film.

About me 
======

This past May, I graduated cum laude from Birmingham-Southern College located in Birmingham, AL. I led four organizations and collected over 10 awards and recognition during my college career, more can be found on my [Work](https://nicolevgarduno.github.io/work/career-experiences) page.

During college, I took several photography classes, where I developed (no pun intended) a real love for analog photography. Take a look at my portfolio [here](https://nicolevgarduno.github.io/photography/). 

As a student, I participated in a number of projects ranging from front end development to using machine learning for more secure digital practices. To read more about my work and participation, please view [here](https://nicolevgarduno.github.io/work/research-projects).

This website was designed using Jekyll. I have always leaned more into back-end developing, so stepping out of my comfort zone to create this website was a blast. That being said, if you see any happy accidents or have any suggestions, let me know! 

I am now pursuing my Master's in Information Security with a focus in Artifical Intelligence at Carnegie Mellon University. 

Thank you so much for visiting my website.
