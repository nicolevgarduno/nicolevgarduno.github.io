üë©üèª‚Äçüíª I am a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University.

üî¨ My research interests include intertwining digital security with artifical intelligence.

üíª I am currently working on protecting user's safety by visualizing PDF documents.

üéûÔ∏è In my free time, I love taking and processing film.

About me 
======

This past May, I graduated cum laude from Birmingham-Southern College located in Birmingham, AL. I led four organizations and collected over 10 awards and recognition during my college career, more can be found on my [Works]([https://nicole page.](https://nicolevgarduno.github.io/teaching/2014-spring-teaching-1) page.
During college, I took several photography classes, where I developed (no pun intended) a real love for analog photography. Take a look at my portfolio [here](https://nicolevgarduno.github.io/portfolio/). 
As a student, I participated in a number of projects ranging from front end development to using machine learning for more secure digital practices. To read more about my work and participation, please view [here](https://nicolevgarduno.github.io/teaching/2015-spring-teaching-1).
This website was designed using Jekyll. I have always leaned more into back-end developing, so stepping out of my comfort zone to create this website was a blast. That being said, if you see any happy accidents or have any suggestions, let me know!
