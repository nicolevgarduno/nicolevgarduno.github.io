During this research project, my Python program web scrapes across the web to gather benign & malicious files. The program then uploadeds each image to Binvis.io which converts the file to a binary visualization model. 
The program then trains a machine learning model using a neural network which learned to differentiate between benign and malicious PDF files by scanning through the binary visualization model. 
Testing included inputing user's files to run through program and test against the model to ensure user's digital safety. Program released a 93% accuracy rate.
