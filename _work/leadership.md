As an active member of my community, I have always enjoyed participating in organizational efforts for students to develop strong teamwork skills.

### Cross Culture Committee

*President* 

Oversaw all organizational activity, events, community connections, and both executive and general board.

The Cross Culture Committee consisted of seven mulitcultural organizations. I managed each branch, serving as a liaison between the organization and our campus leaders.

### We the Neighbors

*President* 

Led college's poverty & homelessness organization to spread word to students about policies and problems in the Birmingham Greater Area.

I worked with several non-profits within the area, helping bring them onto campus to inform students about possible ways to connect and support their missions. I organized a number of events including donation drives, fundraisers, informative talks, and meal serving opportunities.


### Residence Life

*Freshman Dorm House Advisor* 

Managed building events, daily patrolling, and served as a liason between campus leaders and resident advisors (RAs).

I oversaw all freshmen female residents and building RAs. I aided Ras to develop monthly programming to build relationships with residents, managed finances for the building, and communicated between resident advisors and campus police to ensure all policies were regulated. 

### Bonner Leaders

As a nation wide program, the main mission is to provide support to low-income, first-generation, and underrepresented students. The Bonner Network helps students incorporate community engaged learning & civic engagement into their collegiate careers.
